# Dino_genetic_learning

Enter your chrome browser and open the developersTool (F12).

Copy and Paste the content of codeInjector.js into the console.

Wait for the dino to learn to play on it's own!

It can be fast as 7 generetions or it can up to 50 generations before the dino start learning to play well.
It really random. So best thing to do is open like 4 instances and let it run.
(see console logs)
